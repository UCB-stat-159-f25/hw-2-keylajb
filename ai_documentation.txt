I started using ChatGPT at the part of the assignment
 that says: "A working ligo Conda environment"
 because I did not know what to type into the ligo file 
in the environment.yml file. I gave this prompt 
to ChatGPT: "I made a file environment.yml in my hw-2 
folder, but there is nothing in it. how do I get the 
ligo environment in this file? This is the goal of my
assignment: "You will add to this repository an 
environment.yml file that creates an environment 
named ligo, and installs the necessary dependencies 
to properly run this notebook on our hub. A few 
important things to keep in mind:

Check the version of Python that the LIGO notebook is 
using. You will need to explicitly list the Python version
 in your environment.
Take advantage of the LIGO Binder (button in repo README)
 to experiment with which versions of various packages it 
uses, so that you can add those same ones to your 
environment (in their original specification, they did 
not list specific Python versions, so they are frozen in 
time somewhat by accident based on when the Binder was 
last built).
To find a package version, you can print its __version__ 
attribute after importing it in a Python environment. At 
the command line, you can also see the available packages 
in your system using mamba list and pip list respectively 
(depending on whether they were installed with mamba/conda 
or pip). You can filter the list of all the installed 
libraries with the grep command. For example, you can do 
conda env export | grep numpy to quickly find the numpy 
version in the environment.
If a package on Binder has version say 1.2.3, in your 
environment file you should request only 1.2, without the 
third digit. Some revision versions (the three version 
digits are normally known as major.minor.revision) may not
 always be available identically today, so it’s a bit 
safer to request version X.Y than to try to get X.Y.Z and 
have it fail because Z is not available.
Be careful with one package that you will need to list 
explicitly in addition to the scientific libraries and 
ipykernel: decorator. Check its version on Binder. If you 
don’t request it by X.Y version, you will accidentally get 
a much newer version that is not compatible with Python 2.7!
Remember to install the environment for yourself, add its 
kernel, and start running the notebook on the Stat159 
DataHub in that environment. You will have to install 
ipykernel and then create the respective kernel in order 
for this to work." " and ChatGPT responded 
with this: "Perfect — you’re ready to fill your 
environment.yml file with the specifications needed 
for the LIGO notebook. I’ll walk you step by step.
1️⃣ Open the file
If you’re in JupyterLab:
Click your environment.yml file in the file browser.
Open it as a text editor.
Or in the terminal:
nano environment.yml
2️⃣ Add the environment specification
Here’s a ready-to-use template that works for the LIGO notebook (based on typical Binder setup):
name: ligo
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.12
  - numpy=1.26
  - matplotlib=3.8
  - scipy=1.12
  - h5py=3.9
  - decorator=5.1
  - ipykernel=6
Notes:
name: ligo → this is the name of your environment.
channels: tells Conda where to download packages.
dependencies: includes Python and the main libraries your notebook uses.
Versions are major.minor only to avoid incompatibility.
3️⃣ Save the file
In JupyterLab → File → Save
In terminal (nano) → Ctrl+O → Enter → Ctrl+X
4️⃣ Create the environment locally
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ligo
This installs Python + all packages exactly as listed.
Make sure it doesn’t throw any errors.
5️⃣ Add a Jupyter kernel for the environment
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ligo --display-name "Python (ligo)"
Now you can select “Python (ligo)” in JupyterLab for your notebook.
6️⃣ Test
Open LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb → run all cells → no errors. ✅
