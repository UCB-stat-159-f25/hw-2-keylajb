# HW 2: From Notebooks to Research Packages

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-f25/hw-2-keylajb)


_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._


## Overview

This repository restructures the original LIGO tutorial for a Stat 159 class working on learning reproducibility. This repository includes: ipynb_checkpoints, ligotools, BBH_events_v3.json, GW150914_4_template.hdf5, H-H1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5, L-L1_LOSC_4_V2-1126259446-32.hdf5, LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb, README.md, ai_documentation.txt, environment.yml, hw02-description.ipynb, and readligo.py files

## How to use:

Hopefully you can just click the Binder badge at the top of this file and launch the notebook online. You can also try cloning the repository.
